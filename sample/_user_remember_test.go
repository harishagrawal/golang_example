]string, values []interface)
```
Scenario 1: Basic Operation of Remember Function

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the basic functionality of the Remember function, ensuring that keys and associated values are stored correctly in the index.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an Index implementation with controllable methods Put, NillableRet, and Ellip. The keys and values arrays need to contain valid inputs for the Remember function.
  Act: Invoke the Remember function with the mock Index and the keys/values arrays.
  Assert: Check that Index.Put was called the correct number of times with the expected key/value arguments. Warrant that Index.NillableRet was called and Index.Ellip was only called if the first key was "a".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that Remember is storing each key/value pair correctly in the Index, and is calling additional methods appropriately based on input conditions. This test is crucial as it verifies the primary functionality of the Remember function.

Scenario 2: Handling Zero Keys

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the Remember function handles an empty keys list gracefully and does not attempt to use a non-existent key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an Index implementation. Use an empty array for the keys and any array for the values.
  Act: Invoke the Remember function with the mock Index and the empty/non-empty arrays.
  Assert: Ensure that Index.Put was never called, NillableRet was called, and no Index.Ellip method was called.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that Remember early-exits its key/value storage loop and does not attempt to call the Ellip method with a non-existent key. This test is important to confirm good failure management in the application code.

Scenario 3: NillableRet Error Handling

Details:
  Description: This test checks for the correct log output when the NillableRet method errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an Index implementation such that NillableRet will return an error. Keys and values arrays can have any valid inputs.
  Act: Run the Remember function with the mock Index and arrays.
  Assert: Assert that "Woah! [error message]" was logged.
Validation:
  The assertion will confirm that the error message from NillableRet is appropriately logged. It's crucial because it proves the error handling for a common fault scenario in the functionality of the Remember function.

Scenario 4: Remember function when keys[0] is "a"

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Ellip and EllipOnly methods are correctly invoked when the first key is "a".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an Index implementation. The keys array should have "a" as the first item; values can be anything.
  Act: Call the Remember function with the mock Index and the arrays.
  Assert: Confirm that Index.Ellip was called two times with the appropriate arguments and that Index.EllipOnly was called once with the string "arg".
Validation:
  This assertion checks that Remember applies the special treatment to the case where the first key is "a". This test demonstrates the correctness of a separate behavior branch within the Remember function.
