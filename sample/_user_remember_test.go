]string, values []interface)
Scenario 1: Remember Function Normal Execution

Details:
    Description: This test checks the normal functionality of the Remember function. This involves invoking the function with a list of keys and values to confirm it stores these into the index correctly.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock Index object that can capture the Put method calls. Also, create an array of keys and corresponding values to use as input.
    Act: Invoke the Remember function with the mock Index, prepared keys and values.
    Assert: Confirm that the Put method of the Index interface was invoked correctly for each key-value pair.
Validation:
    The assertion logic relies on checking that the Remember function populates the Index with the correct key-value pairs. In practice, this test scenario assures us that the function successfully interacts with the Index object as expected, a fundamental requirement for maintaining the data index.

Scenario 2: Remember Function With 'a' Key Logic Execution

Details:
    Description: This test case checks the specific condition in Remember function when 'a' is used as a key. If the key 'a' is present, Remember will invoke Ellip and EllipOnly methods which is the target of this scenario.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock Index object that can capture the Ellip and EllipOnly method calls. Create an array of keys (including 'a') and corresponding values as input.
    Act: Invoke the Remember function with the mock Index, keys, and respective values.
    Assert: Confirm that the Ellip and EllipOnly methods of the Index interface are invoked correctly.
Validation:
    The assertion logic examines that whenever the 'a' key is present, the corresponding methods are invoked correctly. This test scenario ensures that the specific condition in Remember function related to 'a' key works as per expectation.

Scenario 3: Remember Function NillableRet Error Handling

Details:
    Description: This test checks how Remember function handles error returned by NillableRet method. If an error occurs, the function should log it and terminate.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock Index object that returns an error on the NillableRet method call. Create any array of keys and corresponding values.
    Act: Invoke the Remember function with the mock Index, the keys, and values.
    Assert: Check if the error was logged properly.
Validation:
    Asserting that an error was logged tests that the function handles possible errors correctly. This is vital for the function as it guarantees robust behaviour during runtime which is valuable for overall reliability of the application.
